#Whiteboard Exercises and Tests

###Included are the solutions for whiteboard exercises given to us in class.

####Array Functions

Created a module arrayFunctions.js that contains custom functions that can be called and passed an array.

######Pushy, Popy, Shifty, Unshifty
These mimic the standard array methods.

######Deduplicate
This when passed an array returns an array with any duplicates removed.

######Duplicates
Returns true if duplicate values in the array, false otherwise.

#######CommonStartingLetter
Returns the most common starting letter for an array of words

######CommonLetter
Returns most common letter regardless of position in an array of words.

####Custom Array Prototype Methods

Created customArrayPrototypes.js which adds custom methods to the array prototype.

######Pushy, Popy, Shifty, Unshifty
These mimic the standard array methods.

######Unique
This cleans the array of any duplicate values.

######Frequency2
Returns most common letter regardless of position in an array of words.

####Tests

I added to test files, one to test the arrayFunctions the other to test customArrayPrototypes.

These run using Mocha/Chai, I also created a gulp file to run the tests and lint my code.
